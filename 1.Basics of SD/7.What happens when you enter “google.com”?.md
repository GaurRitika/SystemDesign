## 🧠 PHASE 1: You Type “google.com” and Hit Enter

At this moment, your **browser** initiates the journey.
But before making any request, it must figure out **where “google.com” actually lives (its IP address)**.

That’s where **DNS (Domain Name System)** comes in.

---

## 🌍 PHASE 2: DNS Resolution (Finding Google’s IP Address)

Your computer doesn’t understand “google.com”; it only understands **IP addresses** like `142.250.195.110`.

So the system performs a **DNS lookup** to find this IP.

### 🧩 Step-by-step DNS resolution:

1. **Browser Cache** →
   Browser first checks: “Have I recently looked up google.com?”

   * If yes → uses the cached IP directly.
   * If no → moves on.

2. **OS Cache** →
   Checks your system’s DNS cache.

3. **Router Cache** →
   Your home router might also have cached DNS entries.

4. **ISP’s DNS Resolver** →
   If no cache found, your request goes to your Internet Service Provider’s DNS (like Jio, Airtel, etc.).
   The resolver now starts the full DNS lookup process.

5. **Root DNS Server** →
   It says: “I don’t know google.com, but I can tell you who handles `.com` domains.”

6. **TLD DNS Server** (`.com` server) →
   It responds: “For google.com, go ask the authoritative DNS server.”

7. **Authoritative DNS Server (Google’s own)** →
   Returns the final **IP address** of google.com.

➡️ Result: Your system now knows that `google.com` = `142.250.195.110`.

💡 This entire process usually happens in **milliseconds**, and is cached for future use (using TTL — Time To Live).

## 📡 PHASE 3: Establishing a TCP Connection

Now that your browser knows Google’s IP address, it needs to **connect** to it.
This happens at the **Transport Layer** using **TCP**.

### ⚙️ TCP 3-Way Handshake

1. **SYN** → Your client says “Hey Google, I want to connect.”
2. **SYN-ACK** → Google replies “Okay, I’m ready. Let’s sync up.”
3. **ACK** → Your client confirms and says “Cool, let’s start exchanging data.”

🔁 This ensures a **reliable, ordered connection** between your browser and Google’s server.

---

## 🔒 PHASE 4: HTTPS Handshake (Secure Connection)

Since `https://google.com` uses HTTPS (secure HTTP), before sending actual data, the browser and server perform a **TLS (SSL) handshake**.

### 🧩 Steps in HTTPS Handshake:

1. Browser requests Google’s **digital certificate**.
2. Certificate is verified (issued by a trusted CA like DigiCert or Google Trust Services).
3. Both sides **agree on encryption keys**.
4. All further communication is **encrypted** using those keys.

Now even if someone intercepts your packets, they’ll see only encrypted gibberish.

---

## 🌐 PHASE 5: Sending the HTTP Request

Once the TCP + TLS connections are established, your browser sends the actual request.

### Example:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
User-Agent: Chrome/141.0.0
Accept-Language: en-US
```

This request asks:
“Please give me the home page (/) of google.com.”

---

## 🖥️ PHASE 6: Server Processing (Inside Google’s System)

When the request reaches **Google’s data center**, a lot happens internally:

1. **Load Balancer** receives the request first.

   * It decides which server in which region will handle your request.
   * Example: You’re in India → it routes to the Mumbai or Singapore data center.

2. **Reverse Proxy / CDN (e.g., Google Frontend, GFE)** might serve cached static assets like the Google logo or CSS files.

3. **Application Server** handles the dynamic part — generates personalized content (if logged in).

4. **Database / Search Index** may be queried if needed (for search requests).

5. The server prepares a response — usually HTML or JSON.

---

## 📤 PHASE 7: Sending HTTP Response Back

Server replies with something like:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 14280
```

…and then the **HTML of Google’s homepage** follows.

This data travels **back through the same layers**, but in reverse:

* Server → Internet → Router → ISP → Your device.

---

## 🧩 PHASE 8: Browser Rendering Engine

Your browser (e.g., Chrome) now takes the received HTML and starts rendering it.

1. **HTML Parsing** → builds the **DOM Tree** (structure of page).
2. **CSS Parsing** → builds the **CSSOM Tree** (styles).
3. **JavaScript Execution** → runs scripts, handles events.
4. **Layout & Painting** → combines DOM + CSSOM → visual pixels.
5. **Compositing** → final rendered page displayed on your screen.

During rendering, the browser might make **additional requests**:

* For images (`.jpg`, `.png`)
* CSS files
* JavaScript bundles

Each of these triggers its own mini HTTP/HTTPS request.

---

## 📦 PHASE 9: Caching and Optimization

To make future loads faster:

* Browser caches HTML, CSS, JS, and images.
* DNS results are cached.
* TCP connections might be kept alive (HTTP Keep-Alive).
* CDN caches content globally near users.

---

## ⚙️ PHASE 10: Ongoing Communication (if any)

After page load:

* Browser may open **persistent connections** (WebSockets or HTTP/2 streams) for live updates, analytics, or ads.

## 🧠 Bonus — Interviewer Follow-ups You Should Be Ready For

1. **What happens if DNS fails?**
   → Browser shows “DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_BAD_CONFIG”.

2. **What’s the difference between HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC)?**

3. **What does CDN do in this process?**
   → Reduces latency by serving cached data closer to the user.

4. **What’s the role of load balancers?**
   → Distribute requests to multiple backend servers.

5. **Why is HTTPS handshake expensive and how can we optimize it?**

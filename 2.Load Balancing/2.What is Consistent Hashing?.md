Suppose you have a scalable system , means there is decent amount of users are there . Now , u will have lots of data . So , there is a huge chance that if there is the single database , then this database become a bottleneck.Because a single database can't handle large data.

So , u thought that u will add a different database , i mean this will be like horizontal Scaling.That's means u are adding more databases.

Suppose u use 3 database.
Now , if u do horizontal scaling in the database , means u will now partition data here.Like 33% of total data in each of 3 database. 
Now data is like : 1.Piyush , 2.Jhon , 3.Jane , 4.Alex , 5.Tiger

Now, whenever piysh retrive data , it will be always from partition 0 . But if u lookup piyush data from partition 2 u will nver get it.
Lets use a function:
function f(id){
return id % (no. of database)
}
This function act as a load balancer and known as hash funtion.

But as soon if we increse 1 database extra then problem arises :

Suppose you have a scalable system , means there is decent amount of users are there . Now , u will have lots of data . So , there is a huge chance that if there is the single database , then this database become a bottleneck.Because a single database can't handle large data.

So , u thought that u will add a different database , i mean this will be like horizontal Scaling.That's means u are adding more databases.

Suppose u use 3 database.
Now , if u do horizontal scaling in the database , means u will now partition data here.Like 33% of total data in each of 3 database. 
Now data is like : 1.Piyush , 2.Jhon , 3.Jane , 4.Alex , 5.Tiger

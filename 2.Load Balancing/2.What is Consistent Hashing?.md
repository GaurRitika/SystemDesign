Suppose you have a scalable system , means there is decent amount of users are there . Now , u will have lots of data . So , there is a huge chance that if there is the single database , then this database become a bottleneck.Because a single database can't handle large data.

So , u thought that u will add a different database , i mean this will be like horizontal Scaling.That's means u are adding more databases.

Suppose u use 3 database.
Now , if u do horizontal scaling in the database , means u will now partition data here.Like 33% of total data in each of 3 database. 
Now data is like : 1.Piyush , 2.Jhon , 3.Jane , 4.Alex , 5.Tiger

Now, whenever piysh retrive data , it will be always from partition 0 . But if u lookup piyush data from partition 2 u will nver get it.
Lets use a function:
function f(id){
return id % (no. of database)
}
This function act as a load balancer and known as hash funtion.

But as soon if we increse 1 database extra then problem arises :

Let's deep in the organised notes:
##  Intuition First: Why Do We Need Consistent Hashing?

Imagine you have a **distributed system** — say a caching layer with **multiple servers**:

```
Cache A, Cache B, Cache C
```

and you need to decide **which cache** should store the data for each key (like a user ID or session).

You might use a simple formula:

```text
server_index = hash(key) % number_of_servers
```

 Works fine when the number of servers is fixed.
 But what happens when:

* You **add a new cache server** (for scalability)?
* Or one **server fails** (for fault tolerance)?

The modulus value (`% number_of_servers`) changes → which means **almost all keys** will now map to *different servers*.
That causes **massive data reshuffling** — your entire cache becomes invalid! 

---

##  The Solution: Consistent Hashing

**Consistent Hashing** was designed to solve this *mass re-mapping* problem.

---

###  Basic Idea

Instead of doing `hash(key) % N`, we imagine a **hash ring (circular space)**.

* The hash function maps both **keys** and **servers** into the same hash space.
* The hash space is usually a big circle (like numbers from `0` to `2^32 - 1`).

Example:

```
  0 ──────────────────────────────► 2^32-1
   ↑                              ↓
   └───────────────────────────────┘
```

Servers are placed *around the ring* based on their hash:

```
Cache A → hash("A")
Cache B → hash("B")
Cache C → hash("C")
```

Now, every **key** is also hashed and placed somewhere on the same ring.

Each key is stored on the **first server found clockwise** from its hash position.

---

###  Example

Suppose:

```
Ring positions:
A -> 10
B -> 30
C -> 50
```

If:

```
hash(user_1) = 25 → goes to B (next clockwise after 25)
hash(user_2) = 45 → goes to C
hash(user_3) = 5  → goes to A
```

 Now, if you **add a new server D (at position 40)**:
Only keys that fall between 30–40 move to D.
All other keys stay put.

So instead of moving *all* keys, only a *small portion* gets remapped.
That’s why it’s called **consistent** hashing.

---

##  Why It’s Powerful

| Feature                     | Explanation                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Minimal Key Movement** | When a node joins or leaves, only a small portion of keys are remapped.            |
|  **Load Distribution**    | Keys are spread evenly (with some tweaks like virtual nodes).                      |
|  **Scalability**          | Easily add/remove servers without disturbing the whole system.                     |
|  **Fault Tolerance**      | If a node goes down, affected keys automatically remap to the next available node. |

---

##  Virtual Nodes (VNodes)

In reality, hash distribution might not be perfectly even.
To fix that, each physical server is assigned **multiple positions** (virtual nodes) on the ring.

Example:

```
Server A → hash(A#1), hash(A#2), hash(A#3)
Server B → hash(B#1), hash(B#2), hash(B#3)
```

So the load is more balanced, and no single server ends up with too many or too few keys.

| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Amazon DynamoDB**           | Core of its partitioning logic    |
| **Cassandra**                 | Data partitioning and replication |

##  Visualization Summary

```
        +-------------------+
        |      Server A     | (hash=10)
        +-------------------+
               ↑       |
               |       ↓
        +-------------------+
        |      Server B     | (hash=30)
        +-------------------+
               ↑       |
               |       ↓
        +-------------------+
        |      Server C     | (hash=50)
        +-------------------+
               ↑       |
               |       ↓
              [ Ring loops back ]
```

Keys go clockwise to their nearest server.

---

## Analogy

Think of a **clock** 

* Servers are placed at certain hours (3, 6, 9, 12).
* A key lands on a minute mark.
* It belongs to the *next* hour mark going clockwise.

When you add a new server (say at 4), only keys between 3–4 are affected.
Everything else remains stable.
